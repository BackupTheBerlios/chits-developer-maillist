Hello,

I think migrating to Web 2.0 is a good move. But we do need to
consider that AJAX does not minimize HTTP requests. It might DECREASE
the SIZE of requests, but it usually INCREASES the NUMBER of times an
HTTP request is done.

If low-bandwidth conditions are expected, DHTML might help but AJAX
might not be a good step, unless it is in an intranet environment.

Another good project to look into is Google Gear
(http://code.google.com/apis/gears/index.html). According to the site,
"Google Gears is an open source browser extension that lets developers
create web applications that can run offline." It was just announced a
few weeks ago and it may be worth experimenting with.

If improvements in the interface are what you want, then looking at
pre-loading capabilities of AJAX (usually using JSON) may be
applicable for low-bandwidth situations. But sometimes well-planned
DHTML enhancements may already suffice.

Good luck!

Mike

Web 2.0 also encompasses a number of other things aside AJAX. O'Reily
presents a good overview of what Web 2.0 is:

http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html

Mike is right in saying that AJAX might actually increase the number
of HTTP requests but in an intranet environment (high-bandwidth
situation) this will work well, in an ASP environment it will not.
Google Gears is also another option to explore actually for both the
intranet and ASP environments. The client database I hear runs on
SQL-Lite.

Thanks Mike. You're alive!

Has anyone used twisted?

exelearning.org is based on that and it works very fast...

Our design goals are:

1. reliability in an offline environment (most of the health centers)
2. quicker interface (with refreshes staying on the control -- no need to
page down again)..

With regards data modeling, Alison is finishing up the proposal, but in
essence:

1. the geocode of the health facility (down to barangay level) becomes the
healthcenter_id in db.xml

2. the whole Phil Standard Geocodes are built into the source code

3. CHITS automatically populates the barangay lookup table based on what
geocode is hardcode dinto db.xml

How's that? All we need to do then after evey install is to hard-code the
geocode of the health facility...

If the geocodes can be converted into MySQL we can just create that as
a module so that when it's loaded it automatically handles geocoding
and barangay lookups.

Could be!

Another important functions needed (by capiz) are additional tables for
associating Midwife to Barangay and Barangay to Baramgay health station
(BHS) (one BHS has one or more barangays). These tables are not needed for
the transactions but only for generating reports....
