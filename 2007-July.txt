Hi,

    First time to suggest..

    I've been reading your discussions regarding the use of AJAX and geocodes. You are right that AJAX do increase the HTTP requests, but i think the ultimate goal of using  of AJAX is the richness and responsiveness of application, giving the user a desktop-like experience. Like submitting the form data and displaying the submitted information without refreshing the whole page. I hope you'll consider EXTJS,,

            http://extjs.com/deploy/ext/docs/index.html

It has javascript GUI components,like data grid and some options for using JSON or XML.

Regarding Geocode, there is a free web service here :                             
            
            http://www.geonames.org/export/

They have comprehensive information on world locations, (latitude and longitude coordinates for Philippines included ). Their  web service   can return XML or JSON result set.

Thanks!
Ryan

Mike is right in saying that AJAX might actually increase the number
of HTTP requests but in an intranet environment (high-bandwidth
situation) this will work well, in an ASP environment it will not.
Google Gears is also another option to explore actually for both the
intranet and ASP environments. The client database I hear runs on
SQL-Lite.

Ryan, very nice JS library!

One thing I like about AJAX is the user retains focus on what he/she
is doing since only the part being worked on is refreshed. This focus
facilitates the task being done correctly in the context of a complex
environment such as primary care. It also potentially prevents the
user from putting in incorrect entries by adapting the interface to
the task at hand.
