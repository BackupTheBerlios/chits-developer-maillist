<PRE>Greeting everyone! 

Presently, CHITS end users are collaborating in identifying both the needs and enhancements arising from CHITS. CHITS has been installed in 12 sites as of May 2007. The first batch of end users (Pasay City) have already identified 30+ CHITS related questions that they would have want the application to answer. It is pretty evident that the &quot;data extraction&quot; and report generation mechanism should be first in our priority list.

My suggestion here is to create a separate CHITS tool that has the following components:

1. set of electronic version of paper reports -- there have been changes in the format of the present FHSIS form. The electronic Target Client List (TCL) will be solely accessible to the health center while the City/Provincial Health Office can only view statistical reports (i.e. reports containing numbers only not patient or case details).


2. A dynamic report generator where users can enter values in the search criteria . This is like a more user-friendly version of PhpMyAdmin.

It is also proposed that CHITS be slowly yet fully migrated to the specifications of Web 2.0. I am personally looking at the possibility of integrating AJAX to make the interface touchscreen-ready and minimize the HTTP requests to the server.

The local implementors of CHITS are looking at the possibility of integrating the health center data at the CHO / PHO level. Doc Eloy, even Capiz PHO will include the strategy integration of RHU data in its meeting in the last week of June.

Perhaps, if interconnectivity is the major issue, the solution would probably be portable record exchange as what Dr. Tolentino is mentioning. 

The future development of CHITS is one exciting yet interesting endeavor.




Herman Tolentino &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/chits-developer">herman.tolentino at gmail.com</A>&gt; wrote: Dear everyone,

After a long hiatus, here's an update for this list.

1. Dr. Alvin Marcelo has been working hard to spread the CHITS
paradigm in the Philippines and has succeeded in beginning a tsunami.
A number of provinces (Alvin can give exact number) have signed up for
implementation. The lesson for public health informatics at the level
Alvin is working is -- it is indeed like moving a big elephant. It
takes a lot of convincing for people to move the elephant, more so
convincing the elephant to move himself.

2. CHITS will be receiving another round of funding from the United
Nations Development Program soon.

3. Herman will be developing the HIV/AIDS case surveillance portion of
CHITS for use in the Caribbean (21 countries) for the Carribean
Regional Epidemiology Network. There is no other way to introduce
health information systems unless integrated -- if health information
exchange and standards are the goals. A worthy goal for CHITS would be
to eventually be used as a key application for use by the Health
Metrics Network (HMN). HMN is a worldwide collaborative implemented at
the government level to promote the use of high-quality information
for decision-making. Currently, this remains a dream and is about to
become a nightmare in the context of preparedness.

Next steps for development:

1. Alison Perez, who has been working with CHITS code from the very
beginning is hereby appointed as lead CHITS developer. He will work
with Herman (who will remain the CHITS architect) to conceptualize the
portable record exchange and city health office version (for
surveillance and reporting) for CHITS.

2. Explore and adopt a viable (preferably open-source) model based on
XML for portable records. Challenge for developers would be
conceptualizing the system to create portable records with distributed
encryption. This would assume that the system to create portable
records also handles the clinical notes. Somebody from this list
suggested enhancements and we clearly see that need to accommodate a
wide variety of settings -- but with common data elements for
reporting purposes.

3. We can hold a Skype conference in June to talk about the
development and coordination challenges for CHITS version 2.0. I am
sure we can accommodate the different time zones involved. If you
could kindly provide your time zone (country) to the list we can then
come up with schedule options for the call -- Thanks in advance.

Kind regards,
Herman
